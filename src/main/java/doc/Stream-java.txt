We just want to know the sum of integers but we would also have to provide how the iteration will take place, this is also called external iteration because client program is handling the algorithm to iterate over the list.
The program is sequential in nature, there is no way we can do this in parallel easily.
There is a lot of code to do even a simple task.

To overcome:  all the above shortcomings, Java 8 Stream API was introduced. We can use Java Stream API to implement internal iteration, that is better because java framework is in control of the iteration.

Internal iteration provides several features such as sequential and parallel execution, filtering based on the given criteria, mapping etc.

private static int sumStream(List<Integer> list) {
	return list.stream().filter(i -> i > 10).mapToInt(i -> i).sum();
}//filtering and mapping methods and would increase efficiency

Collections and Java Stream
---------------------------
A collection is an in-memory data structure to hold values and computed eagerly Whereas a java Stream is a data structure that is computed on-demand(lazy).

Java 8 Stream internal iteration principle helps in achieving lazy-seeking in some of the stream operations. For example filtering, mapping, or duplicate removal can be implemented lazily, allowing higher performance and scope for optimization.

Java Stream doesn’t store data, it operates on the source data structure (collection and array) and produce pipelined data that we can use and perform specific operations. Such as we can create a stream from the list and filter it based on a condition.

Java Stream operations use functional interfaces, that makes it a very good fit for functional programming using lambda expression.make our code readable and short.

Java Streams are consumable, so there is no way to create a reference to stream for future usage. Since the data is on-demand, it’s not possible to reuse the same stream multiple times.

Java 8 Stream support sequential & parallel processing, parallel processing achieving high performance for large collections.

Java Stream API interfaces and classes are in the java.util.stream package.there are specific classes for primitive types – IntStream, LongStream and DoubleStream.
 
Creating Java Streams
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1,2,3,4);

Note that it doesn’t support autoboxing, so we can’t pass primitive type array.
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(new Integer[]{1,2,3,4}); 
//works fine

Stream<Integer> stream1 = Stream.of(new int[]{1,2,3,4}); 
//Compile time error, Type mismatch: cannot convert from Stream<int[]> to Stream<Integer>

List<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<>();
for(int i=0; i<100; i++) myList.add(i);
		
//sequential stream
Stream<Integer> sequentialStream = myList.stream();
		
//parallel stream
Stream<Integer> parallelStream = myList.parallelStream();
We can use Stream.generate() and Stream.iterate() methods to create

Converting Java Stream to Collection or Array
--------------------------
intStream = Stream.of(1,2,3,4); //stream is closed, so we need to create it again
Map<Integer,Integer> intMap = intStream.collect(Collectors.toMap(i -> i, i -> i+10));
System.out.println(intMap); //prints {1=11, 2=12, 3=13, 4=14}

Java Stream Intermediate
-------------------------- 

Java Stream API operations that returns a new Stream are called intermediate operations. Most of the times, these operations are lazy in nature, so they start producing new stream elements and send it to the next operation. Intermediate operations are never the final result producing operations. Commonly used intermediate operations are filter and map.

List<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<>();
for(int i=0; i<100; i++) myList.add(i);
Stream<Integer> sequentialStream = myList.stream();

System.out.println(names.map(s -> {
		return s.toUpperCase();
	}).collect(Collectors.toList()));

Stream<String> names2 = Stream.of("aBc", "d", "ef", "123456");
List<String> reverseSorted = names2.sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder()).collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(reverseSorted); // [ef, d, aBc, 123456]
Stream<Integer> highNums = sequentialStream.filter(p -> p > 90); //filter numbers greater than 90

Java Stream Short Circuiting Operations
----------------------------------------
An intermediate operation is called short circuiting, if it may produce finite stream for an infinite stream. For example limit() and skip() are two short circuiting intermediate operations.

A terminal operation is called short circuiting, if it may terminate in finite time for infinite stream. For example anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch, findFirst and findAny are short circuiting terminal operations.

Java Stream Terminal Operations
-----------------------------------
it consumes the stream and after that we can’t use stream. Terminal operations are eager in nature i.e they process all the elements in the stream before returning the result. Commonly used terminal methods are forEach, toArray, min, max, findFirst, anyMatch, allMatch etc. You can identify terminal methods from the return type, they will never return a Stream.

Stream reduce() example: We can use reduce() to perform a reduction on the elements of the stream, using an associative accumulation function, and return an Optional.

Stream<Integer> numbers = Stream.of(1,2,3,4,5)	
Optional<Integer> intOptional = numbers.reduce((i,j) -> {return i*j;});
if(intOptional.isPresent()) System.out.println("Multiplication = "+intOptional.get()); //120

Stream<Integer> numbers1 = Stream.of(1,2,3,4,5);
System.out.println("Number of elements in stream="+numbers1.count()); 

java.util.Optional
----------------------
Java Optional is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. If a value is present, isPresent() will return true and get() will return the value. Stream terminal operations return Optional object. Some of these methods are:
Optional<T> reduce(BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)
Optional<T> min(Comparator<? super T> comparator)
Optional<T> max(Comparator<? super T> comparator)
Optional<T> findFirst()
Optional<T> findAny()


Functional Interfaces in Java 8 Stream
------------------------------------------

Function and BiFunction: Function represents a function that takes one type of argument and returns another type of argument. Function<T, R> is the generic form where T is the type of the input to the function and R is the type of the result of the function.
For handling primitive types, there are specific Function interfaces – ToIntFunction, ToLongFunction, ToDoubleFunction, ToIntBiFunction, ToLongBiFunction, ToDoubleBiFunction, LongToIntFunction, LongToDoubleFunction, IntToLongFunction, IntToDoubleFunction etc.

Predicate and BiPredicate: It represents a predicate against which elements of the stream are tested. This is used to filter elements from the java stream. Just like Function, there are primitive specific interfaces for int, long and double.

Consumer and BiConsumer: It represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. It can be used to perform some action on all the elements of the java stream.

Supplier: Supplier represent an operation through which we can generate new values in the stream. 

List<string> names = students.stream().map(Student::getName).filter(name->name.startsWith("A"))
.collect(Collectors.toList());
